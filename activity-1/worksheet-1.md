## Digital Scholarship Project Examples

### Mapping

[Geography of the Post: U.S. Post Offices in the Nineteenth-Century West](http://cameronblevins.org/gotp). Stunning visualization anchored within the discipline of history, but ripe for critique because it's hard to discern the scholarly argument, as the project lead himself acknowledges.

[Globalization of the US: 1789–1861](http://globalization1789-1861.indiana.edu/exhibit). Exemplifies collaboration between digital collections and special collections. Included both a digital and physical exhibit.

[Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining). This project maps cities based on risk assessment data supplied by government agencies, which was used to make or deny loans at the time, often helping codify and expand practices of racial and class segregation.

### Network Analysis

[Mapping the Republic of Letters](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/). Networks of early modern correspondence, seeking to reveal academic social networks and the ways in which scholarship and ideas were disseminated.

[Six Degrees of Francis Bacon](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/). Collaborative, crowdsourced digital reconstruction of early modern social network.

### Numberic and STEM Data

[CT Scans – #ScanAllFish](https://osf.io/ecmz4). CT scan data for a number of species. Example of data organization, documentation, and presentation. Uses the Open Science Framework, a free platform.

[R Code and Output Supporting: Used-habitat calibration plots: A new procedure for validating species distribution, resource selection, and step-selection models](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181607 ).

[Varieties of Democracy](https://www.v-dem.net/en). Data on various indicators of democracy from around the world. An interesting example with regard to data documentation, analysis, and visualization.

### Text Encoding and Digital Editions

HIST GR8975: What Is a Book in the 21st Century? introduced graduate students at Columbia University to techniques of working with texts in digital environments. During one semester students collectively created this minimal digital edition.

[Women Writers Project](http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu). Longstanding research and teaching project that encodes texts of primary sources using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard. Should appeal to humanities liaisons, as well as metadata specialists.

### Text Analysis
