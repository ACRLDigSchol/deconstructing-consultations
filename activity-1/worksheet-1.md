## Digital Scholarship Project Examples

### Mapping

[Geography of the Post: U.S. Post Offices in the Nineteenth-Century West](http://cameronblevins.org/gotp). Stunning visualization anchored within the discipline of history, but ripe for critique because it's hard to discern the scholarly argument, as the project lead himself acknowledges.

[Globalization of the US: 1789–1861](http://globalization1789-1861.indiana.edu/exhibit). Exemplifies collaboration between digital collections and special collections. Included both a digital and physical exhibit.

[Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining). This project maps cities based on risk assessment data supplied by government agencies, which was used to make or deny loans at the time, often helping codify and expand practices of racial and class segregation.

### Numeric Data

[Varieties of Democracy](https://www.v-dem.net/en). Data on various indicators of democracy from around the world. An interesting example with regard to data documentation, analysis, and visualization.

### STEM Data

[CT Scans – #ScanAllFish](https://osf.io/ecmz4). CT scan data for a number of species. Example of data organization, documentation, and presentation. Uses the Open Science Framework, a free platform.

[R Code and Output Supporting: Used-habitat calibration plots: A new procedure for validating species distribution, resource selection, and step-selection models](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181607 ). Code and data (underlying a journal article) archived in University of Minnesota's DRUM repository.

### Text Encoding

[Women Writers Project](http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu). Longstanding research and teaching project that encodes texts of primary sources using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard. Should appeal to humanities liaisons, as well as metadata specialists.

### Public History

[One Person, One Vote: The Legacy of SNCC and the Fight for Voting Rights](http://onevotesncc.org). Digital public history project. Exemplifies library-community partnerships, working with historical actors.

[Detroit 1967](https://detroit1967.detroithistorical.org/). Community-based oral history project commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the urban uprising in Detroit.

### Digital Exhibits

[Goin' North](https://goinnorth.org/about). Omeka site showcasing stories, biographies, and oral histories of African Americans in Philadelphia related to the Great Migration.

[Hurricane Digital Memory Bank](http://hurricanearchive.org/). Launched in 2005, the Hurricane Digital Memory Bank uses Omeka to collect, preserve, and present the stories and digital record of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
