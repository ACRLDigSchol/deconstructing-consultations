## Deconstruction Questions

Inspired by Miriam Posner's "[How did they make that?](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that)" and a special issue of the *Journal of Digital Humanities* ([Volume 1, No. 4, Fall 2012](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/)), which focused on evaluating digital scholarship.
