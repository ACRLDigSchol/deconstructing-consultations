## Forming a Digital Scholarship Consultation Model with Library Colleagues

### Scenario Description

You are the newly hired Digital Scholarship Librarian and you have been tasked with chairing a working group focused on developing a digital scholarship consultation model. The working group is made up of primarily liaison librarians who split their time between three main responsibilities: reference, instruction, and collection development. They each have varying relationships with departments they liaise with, from very close to nonexistent. Similarly, they are all in different places in terms of skill level and openness to digital scholarship. Some clearly resent being on such a group, which they see as an imposition from administration; others are excited to learn more about a new area that interests them. 

As leader of this working group, you'll have a good deal of say in shaping this new service at your libraryâ€”but taking on this leadership role is daunting!
