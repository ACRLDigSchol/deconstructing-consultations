If you're a liaison librarian or functional specialist curious about how to translate your skills and approaches to reference interviews into strategies for consulting on digital scholarship topics, this hands-on preconference is for you! Learn an overview of the digital scholarship landscape in different emerging topical areas, including research data management, digital humanities, and geospatial data. Delve into breakout sessions featuring hands-on exercises working through different scenarios drawn from the facilitators' personal experiences. All attendees will leave the preconference with a consultation toolkit to reference after the preconference has concluded.

## Learning Outcomes

Preconference participants will be able to...

* Articulate how digital scholarship fits into higher education and why academic libraries are engaging in digital scholarship
* Identify similarities and differences between a traditional reference interview and a digital scholarship consultation
* Identify expertise you already bring to a digital scholarship consultation (e.g., reference interview skills, knowledge of scholarly communication)
* Articulate basics of project management, including elements of a project plan
* Build confidence and self-efficacy as digital scholarship consultants

## Who Should Attend

This preconference is ideally suited for both functional specialists (including digital scholarship, digital humanities, data, and metadata librarians) and subject specialists in liaison librarian roles. Anyone from the library who is drawn into digital scholarship consultation activities would benefit from this hands-on preconference.
